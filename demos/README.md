# Getting TensorFlow Lite Models on Android Apps

TensorFlow Lite makes it very easy to run inference on Android devices. In this guide, you'll learn how to get a pretrained model running in an Android app.

## Setup

First, install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/), the official IDE for Android app development. We'll need this to build and run the Android app.

Next, you need to enable developer mode on your Android device:

1. Open the Settings application on your phone.
2. Scroll down to the "About Phone" or "About Device" section.
3. Find the section titled "Build number" and tap it seven times.
4. Now, go back to the main Settings page. You should find "Developer Options" either in the main page, or under the "System" tab.

Now enable USB debugging in the "Developer Options" tab.
