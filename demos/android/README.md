# Getting TensorFlow Lite Models on Android Apps

[TensorFlow Lite](https://tensorflow.org/lite) makes it very easy to run inference on Android devices. In this guide, you'll learn how to get a pretrained model running in an Android app.

## Setup

First, install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/), the official IDE for Android app development. We'll need this to build and run the Android app.

Next, you need to enable developer mode on your Android device:

1. Open the Settings application on your phone.
2. Scroll down to the "About Phone" or "About Device" section.
3. Find the section titled "Build number" and tap it seven times.
4. Now, go back to the main Settings page. You should find "Developer Options" either in the main page, or under the "System" tab.

Now enable USB debugging in the "Developer Options" tab.

## Building the App

We provide an example Android app that runs our [Visual Wake Words](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05721) demo, so you can use it if you don't want to build your own app:

```
git clone https://github.com/mit-han-lab/VWW
```

Now, let's open up Android Studio and open the project. Click on `Open an existing project` and select `VWW/demos/android` as the project folder.

Using a USB cable, plug your Android device into your computer. Then, hit `Build -> Make Project` (or `âŒ˜F9`) to build the project. 

## Running the App on Your Device

Simply hit `Run -> Run 'app'` to run the app on your device. You should now have a working image classifier that performs live person detection.

## Running Other Pretrained Models

If you want to run other classification models using this app, you need to edit a few lines of code. 

First, add your pretrained model into the `assets` folder of the project. Also edit the `labels.txt` file to match the class labels of your task.

Next, open up the `ClassifierFloatVWW` and `ClassifierQuantizedVWW` files in the `tflite` folder. Change the functions `getImageSizeX()` and `getImageSizeY()` in both files to return the proper image sizes. 

Then, change the function `getModelPath()` in both files to the file name of your pretrained model.

Finally, rebuild the project, connect your device, and run!
